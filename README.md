This is the README for the Ex1 assignment in intro to computing.
This assignment required me to build a basic calculator\ convertor
across bases, from binary to hexadecimal. This is my solution, 
using my understanding of java. I have attempted to implement and improve
the suggested solution. Have fun! ðŸ˜Š
